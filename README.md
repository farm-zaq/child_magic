# Pool Generation

This allows for pool generating with seed based RNG

Pools will be generated and put in the output folder. For each player, a file will be generated with their pool.

Output files are formatted so they can be copy pasted straight into moxfield.

More verbose output will also be printed (and can be seen in dump.txt)

## Usage

Run ```python generate_pools.py {seed}```

The output was generated with ```python generate_pools.py 1```

## Why Seeds?

Seed based RNG allows you all to know that I am not cheating!

We will come up with a seed together on Wednesday and then generate pools.

I can't know the seed in advance, so I can't do anything sketchy. You can also independently run this script with the same seed to verify that the results are correct.
